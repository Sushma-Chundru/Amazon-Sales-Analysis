# London Bikerides Analysis 

In this project, we delve into the bustling urban landscape of London to uncover insights into the city's cycling habits and trends. Leveraging publicly available data on bike rides within the city, we employ a range of data analysis and visualization techniques to understand patterns, preferences, and behaviors of cyclists.

## Key Objectives
Analyze trends and patterns in London's bike ride data.
Visualize spatial and temporal aspects of bike rides to identify hotspots and peak times.
Investigate the influence of external factors such as weather and seasonality on cycling behavior.
Build predictive models to forecast future bike ride trends.
Provide insights for urban planning, policy-making, and promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation.

## Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover cycling patterns and trends.
Data visualization using Excel, Tableau, and Jupyter notebooks.
Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
Insights for urban planning and policy-making.
